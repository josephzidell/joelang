# joelang
A scripting language focused on easy reading. [Read the docs](https://joelang.dev)

## Quick Start

```bash
# compile a .joe file (ATM only analyzes)
./joec main.joe # outputs 3 files [main.tokens, main.parse-tree, main.ast.json]

# There is an example .joe file at examples/example1/main.joe

# play with the compiler, parser, or lexer
./joec -i '...' # run the compiler; will output the AST as objects
./joec -i '...' --json # run the compiler; will output the AST as JSON
./joec -i '...' -p # parse only, do not analyze; will output the Parse Tree
./joec -i '...' -l # (that's the lowercase L, not the number 1) lexify only, do not parse; will console.table()'s the Tokens

# run the transpiler
npm run --silent transpile -- <lang> 'your expression' # transpile an expression
npm run --silent transpile -- <lang> "$(cat path/to/file.joe)" # transpile a .joe file
npm run --silent transpile -- <lang> '...' file.<ext> # send the new code to a file

# run the tests
npm test
```

## Challenge
Many languages are verbose and difficult to read. The goal of joelang is for the developer to read code smoothly, and not have to do mental gymnastics to understand the flow of logic.

Let's establish a few ground truths, which I think we can agree on:
- Code is read far more often than it is written
- Code maintenace is longer than the time it took to write the original version
- Computing power is now cheaper than human time


## Solution
[KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle). Keep the syntax simple, and easy to read and understand.

In reality, simplicity is hard. But we do the hard work so you can do the easy work.
